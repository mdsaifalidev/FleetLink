# FleetLink - Logistics Vehicle Booking System

FleetLink is a comprehensive full-stack application for managing and booking logistics vehicles for B2B clients. The system provides robust backend APIs and an intuitive frontend interface for vehicle fleet management.

## üèó Architecture

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive unit tests
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose

## üöÄ Features

### Backend APIs
- **POST /api/vehicles**: Add new vehicles to the fleet
- **GET /api/vehicles/available**: Search for available vehicles based on capacity, route, and time
- **POST /api/bookings**: Create vehicle bookings with conflict prevention
- **GET /api/bookings**: View all bookings (bonus feature)
- **DELETE /api/bookings/:id**: Cancel bookings (bonus feature)

### Frontend Interface
- **Add Vehicle Page**: Form to add new vehicles with validation
- **Search & Book Page**: Search available vehicles and create bookings
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages

### Core Features
- ‚úÖ **Availability Checking**: Prevents double-bookings with time overlap detection
- ‚úÖ **Capacity Filtering**: Only shows vehicles with sufficient capacity
- ‚úÖ **Route-based Duration**: Simplified pincode-based ride duration calculation
- ‚úÖ **Race Condition Prevention**: Re-verification before booking creation
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests for critical backend logic
- ‚úÖ **Data Validation**: Input validation on both frontend and backend

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (v7.0 or higher)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized setup)

### Option 1: Local Development

#### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your MongoDB connection string
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fleetlink
# PORT=5000

# Start MongoDB (if running locally)
mongod

# Run backend server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open browser to http://localhost:5173
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd fleetlink

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

Services will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:4000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- MongoDB: localhost:27017

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Tests
The backend includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ Vehicle creation with validation
- ‚úÖ Availability search with capacity filtering
- ‚úÖ Booking overlap detection
- ‚úÖ Booking creation with conflict prevention
- ‚úÖ Edge cases and error handling
- ‚úÖ Helper function validation

### Test Results Example
```
PASS ./server.test.js
‚úì POST /api/vehicles should create a new vehicle with valid data
‚úì should return 400 for missing required fields
‚úì should return available vehicles with correct capacity
‚úì should not return vehicles with overlapping bookings
‚úì should create a booking for available vehicle
‚úì should return 409 for conflicting booking
‚úì calculateRideDuration should work correctly
‚úì hasBookingOverlap should detect overlaps
```

## üîß API Documentation

### Vehicle Management

#### Add Vehicle
```http
POST /api/vehicles
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Heavy Duty Truck",
  "capacityKg": 2000,
  "tyres": 8
}
```

#### Search Available Vehicles
```http
GET /api/vehicles/available?capacityRequired=500&fromPincode=110001&toPincode=110005&startTime=2023-10-27T10:00:00Z
```

### Booking Management

#### Create Booking
```http
POST /api/bookings
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "vehicleId": "vehicle_id_here",
  "fromPincode": "110001",
  "toPincode": "110005",
  "startTime": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z",
  "customerId": "customer123"
}
```

## üßÆ Core Logic

### Ride Duration Calculation
The system uses a simplified formula for demonstration:
```javascript
estimatedRideDurationHours = Math.abs(parseInt(toPincode) - parseInt(fromPincode)) % 24
```

**Note**: This is a placeholder logic. In production, you would integrate with mapping services like Google Maps API or HERE API for accurate duration calculation.

### Booking Overlap Detection
The system prevents double-bookings by checking for time overlaps:
- Checks if any existing booking overlaps with the requested time window
- Re-verifies availability just before creating a booking to prevent race conditions
- Uses MongoDB queries to efficiently find overlapping bookings

### Time Window Logic
```javascript
// Example overlap detection
startTime: 10:00 AM, endTime: 12:00 PM (existing booking)
newStart: 11:00 AM, newEnd: 1:00 PM (new request)
// Result: OVERLAP DETECTED - booking rejected
```
